Try giving fewer than three arguments to your script. See that error you get? See if you can explain it.
Write a script that has fewer arguments and one that has more. Make sure you give the unpacked variables good names.
Combine input with argv to make script that gets more input from user. Don't overthink it. Just use argv to get something, and input to get something else from the user.
Remember that modules give you features. Modules. Modules. Remember thsi becaus we'll need it later.


The program will giving you ValueError: not enought value to unpack bacause it's expect three variable!

I'll create ex13drill.py to accomodate that.

I'll do that

Alright
